  <p>Hummingbird has a few core goals that guide the design and development of the language.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usable type system</strong>: The type system in Hummingbird is designed to make life easier for programmers. Typed, static compilation provides a set of assurances not available in dynamic languages.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptable targeting</strong>: Initially Hummingbird will target just Node.js and browser JavaScript execution environments. However, the intrinsic features of these targets should be exposed as a rich runtime API library rather than a core part of the language.</li>
    <li><strong>Concise, structured syntax</strong>: Taking the lessons of JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and Swift to heart, Hummingbird's syntax aims to establish a pleasant balance between explicit code structure and minimizing unnecessary punctuation.</li>
  </ul>
