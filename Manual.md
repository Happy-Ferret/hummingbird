# Manual

This is a step-by-step overview of the Hummingbird language. It covers—with examples—the various aspects of the language.

## Basic Concepts

Hummingbird has a few core goals that guide the design and development of the language.

* **Usable type system**: The type system in Hummingbird is designed to make life easier for programmers. Typed, static compilation provides a set of assurances not available in dynamic languages.
* **Adaptable targeting**: Initially Hummingbird will target just Node.js and browser JavaScript execution environments. However, the intrinsic features of these targets should be exposed as a rich runtime API library rather than a core part of the language.
* **Concise, structured syntax**: Taking the lessons of JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and Swift to heart, Hummingbird's syntax aims to establish a pleasant balance between explicit code structure and minimizing unnecessary punctuation.
