<h1>Specification</h1>
<p>Semi-formal specification of the syntax and semantics of the Hummingbird language.</p>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>There are two types of variable definitions: <code>var</code> and <code>let</code>. The former declares a <strong>mutable</strong> variable in the scope. The latter declares an <strong>immutable</strong> variable in the scope.</p>
<p>Immutability is checked at only the reference level. (It ensures that the variable will always refer to the same thing; however mutating properties of that thing can still occur!) Furthermore, this checking happens only at compile time.</p>

<div class="spec js"><code><pre>var a = 1;
var b = 2;</pre></code>
<div class="spec hb"><code><pre>var a: Integer = 1
let b: Integer = 2</pre></code>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Hummingbird provides first-class, anonymous functions.</p>

<div class="spec js"><code><pre>var a = function (x) { };</pre></code>
<div class="spec hb"><code><pre>var a = func (x: String) -> String { }</pre></code>
